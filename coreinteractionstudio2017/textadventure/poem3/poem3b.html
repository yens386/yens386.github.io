 			<p> 1. We all dream every night: our brains are active throughout the night. But after we wake up, we often don't remember much about our dreams.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div id = "fact2">
 			<p> 2. We dream most vividly during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep: some of our sleep has vivid, structured thoughts - or dreams. These occur during a stage of sleep that is called REM sleep. REM sleep occurs in short episodes across each night each about 90 minutes apart. Our longer dreams are in the morning hours.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div id = "fact3">
 			<p> 3. We are specially wired not to act out our dreams: during REM sleep many of our muscles relax completely and this prevents us acting out our dreams. If this system doesnâ€™t work properly we may try to act out our dreams, especially if the dreams involve strong emotions.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div id = "fact4">
 			<p> 4. Many dreams are bizarre because part of our brain shuts down: when we are awake the front part of our brain controls how we make sense of the world. This shuts down during dreaming. Because of this, the dreaming brain puts together ideas that normally do not go together.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div id = "fact5">
 			<p> 5. Most dreams relate to recent awake experiences: dreams are often linked to real life events from the past. Usually these are events or thoughts from one to two days before the dream.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div id = "fact6">
 			<p> 6. We dream in pictures: about two thirds of dreams are mainly visual, with fewer that involve sounds, movement, taste or smell. Colour is only in about a third of all dreams. It has been said that when we are awake we think in ideas, but when asleep we think in pictures.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div id = "fact7">
 			<p> 7. We can learn to control our dreams: many people have bad dreams or nightmares. These can happen over and over again. But people can change the events in these dreams to be less frightening. First, write down memories of the scary dream. After this think about how it might end differently.</p>
