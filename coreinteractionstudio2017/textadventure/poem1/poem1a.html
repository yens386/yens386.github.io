 			<p>Dreams are a universal human experience that can be described as a state of consciousness characterized by sensory, cognitive and emotional occurrences during sleep. The dreamer has reduced control over the content, visual images and activation of the memory.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div id="textwrap">
 			<p>Reports of dreams tend to be full of emotional and vivid experiences that contain themes, concerns, dream figures, objects, etc. that correspond closely to waking life. These elements create a novel "reality" out of seemingly nothing, producing an experience with a lifelike timeframe and lifelike connections.</p>
