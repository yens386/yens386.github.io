During Sina Bahramâ€™s ILEAD Keynote, he centered around the main idea of universal design and accessibility. He states that universal design refers to producing things that are inherently accessible to everyone and accessibility refers to the ability for all people to use a product, place or service, regardless of functional limitations. As designers, I feel that sometimes we forget to think about those disabled, those who are in a wheelchair or those who are blind, even though we should also consider their inaccessibility and do something about it. Because we are so focused on the general public, we constantly overlook those who are unable to access certain things in our world whether it be a product, place or service. Bahrain discusses the 7 principles of universal design that range from interaction, experience, tolerance for error, physical effort, and much more. All of which consider not only disabled people, but also everyone in our society how universal design can be accessible to everyone. In my opinion, I believe that we should focus on all audiences and not just an audience that we want or expect. By doing so, we are able to design for a broader audience as well as make the world a better place.
