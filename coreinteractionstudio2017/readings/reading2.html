"Interaction is a way of framing the relationship between people and objects designed for them—and thus a way of framing the activity of design." Observing the things around me, I never noticed how much of an impact design has in our world. Everything we see around us it designed in some shape or form; someone thoughtfully mapped out how to create this specific object and how a person should interact with it. This article discussing what is interaction clearly shows all of the aspects that interaction is involved in; whether it be in a system, process, auto/manual, and much more. What I found most interesting is the definition of what interaction is. It says that Usman Haque says, “designers often use the word ‘interactive’ to describe systems that simply react to input,” for example, describing a set of Web pages connected by hyperlinks as “interactive multimedia.” In my eyes, I believe that this is the definition of interaction, however, there are different levels of intereaction; some maybe much more advanced and some may be simple. However, Haque later then argues to say that the process of clicking on a link isn't interaction, but more of a reaction. Although I do agree with this statement, however, the interaction comes when the user physically clicks onto a specific link and the result becomes a reaction. Throughout reading this article, I found that this way of thinking about what interaction is creates an in-depth thought process of how we can design around the idea of interaction.
