Donyae Coles writes in his article, "How Reporting and Moderation on Social Media is Failing Marginalized Groups", that employees working on big social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are banning certain people because of hate speech and harassing people based on race, gender, or religion. He writes that "white people have a very loose understanding of systemic issues and often take disucssions of these issues as 'reverse racism', which means they are often poorly suited to make decisions about content that affects marginalized people." This topic not only is about racism but anything in general that may against one's values. For example, I have had multiple friends who have posted photos of them showing more skin such as their nipples and their photos have been anonymously reported and therefore, their photo was deleted or their account had been banned for a couple of days. We use social media as a way to express ourselves and who we are, however, because of a lot of social media's term and agreements, there is always that boundary that we can't go over because it might go against someone else's values. Many things become censored because it might be okay to show to some people but others might be completely against it. It's difficult to cater to everyone's core values, however, we would rather stay on the safe side rather than go to the extreme. Coles article touches upon a more specific view point of racism and white supremecy in Twitter and Facebook, however, this issue goes much broader.
