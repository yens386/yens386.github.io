<h1>Response to Reading #1</h1>

<p>Before coming to Parsons, I had no knowledge about UI/UX design and had no idea that it was connected to design. In my mind, I was completely oblivious to the design of a simple clothing brand website or even looking something up on Google. However, I realized that the placement of these buttons we click online all have a reason. Reading through Bill Atkinson's journey as a interaction designer reflects upon every UI/UX designer's thought process; putting yourself in the audience's shoes.  He states, "in the user interface design, a lot of it was by trial and error. We tried different things and found out what did and didnâ€™t work. A lot of it was empirically determined." This process of becoming the audience and trying to see what a viewer would do determines whether or not certain elements work well or jeopardize it. As an interaction designer, putting yourself as the viewer improves not only the design process but also the outcome.</p>
